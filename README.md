# Algorithm Solver & Chess AI Visualizer

**NOTE: This is just a frontend part of this project which is still under development.** I will soon upload a backend version.

This project is a **frontend** visualizer built with React that includes:
- **Algorithm Solver Visualizer**: A tool to visually demonstrate different algorithms.
- **Chess Board with Stockfish Engine**: A chess interface where Stockfish will compete against an AI model you will develop.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Visualizer**: A visual representation of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm used in game AI decision-making.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all dependencies required for the project.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. The production build is optimized for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## Features

### Algorithm Solver Visualizer
- Supports multiple algorithms with step-by-step visualization.
- Useful for understanding algorithm efficiency and behavior.

### Chess AI with Stockfish Engine
- Interactive chessboard interface.
- Integrates Stockfish chess engine.
- Future integration: AI model to compete against Stockfish.

### Alpha-Beta Pruning Visualizer
- Step-by-step visualization of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm.
- Helps understand how AI minimizes computations in decision-making.

## Screenshots
